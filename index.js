  # rtc-sip

  This is an experiment at providing an integration between the rtc.io modules
  and the [SIP.js](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js) library.  This is done by
  providing a custom SIP.js `mediaHandlerFactory` that can be used to override
  the default WebRTC behaviour of SIP.js

  ## Example Usage

  To be completed.
