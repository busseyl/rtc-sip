/**
  # rtc-sip

  This is an experiment at providing an integration between the rtc.io modules
  and the [SIP.js](https://github.com/onsip/SIP.js) library.  This is done by
  providing a custom SIP.js `mediaHandlerFactory` that can be used to override
  the default WebRTC behaviour of SIP.js

  ## NOTE: Incomplete

  This package has been implemented to the point that it is usable for the
  following purpose:

  - Using a SIP endpoint to attach to a WebRTC call for the purposes of
    recording audio.

  While other features will be implemented over time, these is not as high
  a priority as other implementation tasks within the rtc.io suite.

  ## Example Usage

  To be completed.
